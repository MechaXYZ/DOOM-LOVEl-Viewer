# A DOOM level viewer made in LÃ–VE
Made by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdYTvqZmyBk&list=PLi77irUVkDasNAYQPr3N8nVcJLQAlANva) tutorial.
I put this out here because I want someone to fix these issues:
* textures are slightly off, some very off
* back walls sometimes render
* sky hack isn't working
